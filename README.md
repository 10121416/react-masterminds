# React Masterminds

A basic game of guessing a number based on various degrees of difficulty. The objective of the game is to guess a number that is randomly generated by the game engine. On each guess, the game will indicate (using a message and color) how close (or far) your guess is from the actual generated number. Upon guessing the correct number, one is presented with the option to play again.

The game provides 3 difficulty level settings, namely, easy, medium, and hard. Based on the difficulty setting, the game engine will generate a random number that falls within a number range. For example:

* Easy - 0 -> 10
* Medium - 0 -> 100
* Difficult - 0 -> 1000

The application is composed of a single _Game_ component that uses a _GuessEngine_ class to manage the game logic.

This project also demonstrates:

* a typcial React project layout structure
* babel setup and configuration
* webpack setup and configuration
* eslint setup and configuration
* SCSS setup and configuration
